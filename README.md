## Arithmetic Expression Examples
Below are some examples of basic arithmetic operations.
# Code cell to multiply and add numbers
a = 5
b = 10
multiplication = a * b
addition = a + b
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Addition:", addition)
# Code cell to convert minutes to hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
print(minutes, "minutes is equal to", hours, "hours")
